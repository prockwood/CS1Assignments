Assignment 1 - ohm's law V=IR 



Assignment:  
Ohm’s Law is a formula that describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance within a circuit. Using the Web, locate the formula for Ohm’s Law. Write a program that inputs (from the user) current (measured in Amps) and resistance (measured in Ohms) within a given circuit. Calculate the voltage (measured in Volts) needed to supply the circuit and output the results.
